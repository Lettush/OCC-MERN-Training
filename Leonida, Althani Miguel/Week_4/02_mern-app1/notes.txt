Salt Iteration

Iteration 1:

Salt: "abcd1234"
Password: "mypassword"
Combine Salt and Password: "abcd1234mypassword"
Hash the Combined Value (e.g., using a hash function like bcrypt): "h1a1s2h3e4d5"
Iteration 2:

Salt: "abcd1234"
Password: "h1a1s2h3e4d5" (the hash from the previous iteration)
Combine Salt and Password: "abcd1234h1a1s2h3e4d5"
Hash the Combined Value: "p2a2s3s4w5o6r7d8"
Iteration 3:

Salt: "abcd1234"
Password: "p2a2s3s4w5o6r7d8" (the hash from the previous iteration)
Combine Salt and Password: "abcd1234p2a2s3s4w5o6r7d8"
Hash the Combined Value: "f9i0n1a2l3h4a5s6h7"
