HTTP Request Methods:
HTTP defines several request methods that indicate the desired action to be performed on a resource. Each method has a specific purpose and determines how the server should handle the request. Here are some commonly used HTTP request methods:

(Create) POST - Submits data to be processed to a specified resource. It is often used to create new resources on the server.

(Read)GET - Retrieves data from a specified resource. It should only retrieve data and should not have any other side effects.

(Update)PUT - Updates an existing resource with new data. It replaces the entire resource with the new data provided.

(Delete)DELETE - Deletes a specified resource

PATCH - Partially updates an existing resource
